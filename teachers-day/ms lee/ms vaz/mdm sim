# 沈老师 C: <h1>

*parody of fireworks by katy perry*


### First Impression <h3>
*first verse*
Have you ever thought
That she's a fierce teacher
When you saw her face
And then thought you're dead?

Did you ever feel
Her expectations were high?
Looking at your marks
With that frown on her face

But then you realised 
that there could be a chance,
And she wasn't that fierce 
as you thought she was
