_first verse_
Have you ever thought that she's a fierce teacher
When you see her face
And then thought you were dead?

Did you ever feel her expectations were high?
Looking at your marks
With that frown on her face

But then you realised that maybe,
she wasn't that fierce 
as you thought she was at first
