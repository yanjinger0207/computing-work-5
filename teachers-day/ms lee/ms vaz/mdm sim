## 沈老师 C: <h1>

*parody of fireworks by katy perry*


## First Impression <h3>
*first verse*
Have you ever thought
That she's a fierce teacher
When you see her face
And then thought you;re dead?

Did you ever feel
Her expectations were high?
Looking at your marks
With that frown on her face

But then you realised 
that there could be a chance,
And she wasn't that fierce 
as you thought she was
